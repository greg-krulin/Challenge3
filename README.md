# Challenge3


In this challenge we were assigned to import data, clean data, and analyze data from the bitcoin exchanges Bitstamp and Coinbase.
Tools used in the analysis were dataframes and series with their functions from pandas, and plotting from matplotlib.

What was discovered in this assignment was that as time passed from 01/01/2018 to 03/31/2018 prices between the two exchanges equalized and profitable arbitrage opportunities disappeared.
